Amity, Arkansas is a peaceful small town tucked into the Ouachita region, making it an ideal base for exploring nearby rivers, lakes, and state parks. While the town itself offers a quiet historic square and local charm, the real draw is its location.

Within a short drive, visitors can float the Caddo River, relax along Lake Greeson, explore Daisy State Park, or take a day trip to Crater of Diamonds State Park. Amity offers the kind of slow pace and simplicity that makes it easy to disconnect while still being close to some of Arkansas’ most popular outdoor destinations.
